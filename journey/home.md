Welcome,

YieldMore.org was derived from the "YIELD" acronym in 2013, which means "Every Day Is Your Last" - an imperative to make the most of time, not just for ourselves, but the world.

It [spans 6 websites](%url%our-history/) and gave birth to [AmadeusWeb in 2019](%amadeus-url%) and [AmadeusWeb World](%world-url%) in 2025 and launched me as a "[writer](%url%imran/writing/)", still determined to put my [thoughts out there](%world-url%people/imran/).
